## 🧹 Cleaning Rules & Justifications

### 1. Inconsistent City Names
**Rule:** Standardize using mapping dictionary  
**Justification:** City is a critical dimension for geographic analysis. Inconsistent values would break aggregations and filters.  
**Action:** Map all variants to standard names (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah)

### 2. Missing Unit Costs
**Rule:** Impute as 50% of base_price_aed  
**Justification:** Without cost, we cannot calculate margins. 50% represents typical retail markup.  
**Action:** Set `unit_cost_aed = base_price_aed * 0.5`

### 3. Missing Discounts
**Rule:** Set to 0 (no discount)  
**Justification:** Most products are sold at full price. Missing likely means no discount was applied.  
**Action:** Fill NaN with 0

### 4. Duplicate Order IDs
**Rule:** Keep latest by timestamp  
**Justification:** Duplicates could be data entry errors or system glitches. Latest record is most accurate.  
**Action:** Drop duplicates, keeping row with max timestamp

### 5. Corrupted Timestamps
**Rule:** Drop the record  
**Justification:** Cannot reliably fix "not_a_time" or "2024-13-45". Time is essential for trend analysis.  
**Action:** Remove rows with unparseable timestamps

### 6. Outlier Quantities
**Rule:** Cap at 20 units  
**Justification:** Quantities of 50-75 are likely data entry errors (extra zero). B2C orders rarely exceed 20.  
**Action:** Set `qty = 20` if qty > 20

### 7. Outlier Prices
**Rule:** Cap at 10,000 AED  
**Justification:** Prices 10-15× normal are likely decimal point errors. Our max product price is ~4,000 AED.  
**Action:** Set `selling_price_aed = 10000` if > 10000

### 8. Impossible Inventory
**Rule:** Negative → 0, Extreme → 500  
**Justification:** Physical inventory cannot be negative. 9999 is a placeholder value.  
**Action:** Set to 0 if negative, cap at 500 if > 1000

   ```

10. **Budget Utilization %** - How much of budget is used
    ```
    (Promo Spend / Promo Budget) × 100
    ```

### Operational KPIs (Manager View)

11. **Stockout Risk %** - Percentage of SKUs at risk
    ```
    (COUNT(simulated_qty > stock_on_hand) / TOTAL_SKUS) × 100
    ```

12. **Return Rate %** - Product return frequency
    ```
    (COUNT(return_flag = 'Y') / TOTAL_ORDERS) × 100
    ```

13. **Payment Failure Rate %** - Failed transaction rate
    ```
    (COUNT(payment_status = 'Failed') / TOTAL_ORDERS) × 100
    ```

14. **High Risk SKUs** - Count of items likely to stock out
    ```
    COUNT(simulated_qty > stock_on_hand)
    ```

## 🎯 Demand Uplift Logic (Rule-Based, No ML)

### Base Assumption
Higher discounts drive more demand, but the effect varies by channel and category.

### Uplift Formula
```python
uplift_factor = base_uplift × channel_multiplier × category_multiplier

Where:
  base_uplift = 1 + (discount_pct / 10)
  # Example: 20% discount → 1 + 2.0 = 3.0x demand
```

### Channel Multipliers
- **Marketplace:** 1.3× (price-sensitive customers)
- **App:** 1.2× (push notifications drive urgency)
- **Web:** 1.0× (baseline, more browsing behavior)

### Category Multipliers
- **Electronics:** 1.2× (high-value, discount-driven)
- **Fashion:** 1.2× (seasonal, promotion-sensitive)
- **Beauty:** 1.1× (moderate sensitivity)
- **Sports:** 1.1× (moderate sensitivity)
- **Others:** 1.0× (grocery, books - less elastic)

### Example Calculation
```
Product: Samsung Galaxy Phone (Electronics)
Channel: Marketplace
Discount: 25%
Baseline Daily Demand: 5 units

uplift_factor = (1 + 25/10) × 1.3 × 1.2
              = 3.5 × 1.3 × 1.2
              = 5.46

Simulated Demand = 5 × 5.46 = 27.3 → 27 units/day
For 14 days = 27 × 14 = 378 units
```

### Limitations & Risks
1. **No historical validation** - Assumes linear relationship
2. **Channel overlap** - Customers use multiple channels
3. **Competitor response** - Doesn't account for competitive promotions
4. **Seasonality** - Same uplift assumed year-round
5. **Saturation** - Very high discounts may not increase demand proportionally

## ⚖️ Constraint Enforcement

### 1. Promo Budget Cap
**Constraint:** Total promo spend ≤ Budget  
**Check:** `SUM(promo_spend) <= promo_budget_aed`  
**Violation Action:** Flag budget exceeded, show top 10 contributors

### 2. Margin Floor
**Constraint:** Overall margin % ≥ Margin floor  
**Check:** `(Total Margin / Total Revenue × 100) >= margin_floor_pct`  
**Violation Action:** Flag margin risk, show products dragging margin down

### 3. Stock Availability
**Constraint:** Simulated qty ≤ Stock on hand  
**Check:** `simulated_qty <= stock_on_hand` (per product-store)  
**Violation Action:** Flag stockout risk, show top 10 shortfall items

## 🧠 Critical Thinking Answers

### 1. Which cleaning rules could change business decisions the most?

**Answer:** The **duplicate order removal** and **outlier capping** rules have the highest impact.

- **Duplicates:** If we kept all duplicates instead of just the latest, revenue would be artificially inflated by ~0.5%. This could lead to over-optimistic sales targets and inventory planning.
  
- **Outlier Qty/Price:** If we didn't cap extreme values, a single order with qty=75 at 15× price would skew average order value and demand forecasts. This could trigger unnecessary inventory buildups or mispriced promotions.

**Alternative Approach:** Instead of automatic capping, we could flag outliers for manual review. High-value B2B orders might legitimately have qty=50. However, under time pressure, automatic rules are more practical.

### 2. What uplift assumptions did you choose, and how could they be wrong?

**Assumptions:**
- Base uplift = 1 + (discount/10) → Linear relationship
- Marketplace reacts 30% more than Web
- Electronics/Fashion are 20% more price-sensitive

**Potential Errors:**
1. **Non-linear effects:** Discounts above 30% might show diminishing returns (customers doubt quality)
2. **Channel cannibalization:** App users might just switch from Web, not create new demand
3. **Temporal factors:** Ramadan/Eid promotions would have different uplift than normal periods
4. **Brand effects:** Premium brands (Apple) may see less uplift than budget brands
5. **Stock visibility:** If customers see "low stock" warnings, demand might surge regardless of discount

**How to Improve:** A/B test different discount levels in one city first, then calibrate the uplift model with actual data.

### 3. If budget is fixed, how do you choose between margin floor vs stockout risk?

**Trade-off:**
- **Lower margin floor** → Can offer deeper discounts → Higher stockout risk
- **Higher margin floor** → Shallower discounts → Lower stockout risk → Less demand uplift

**Decision Framework:**

**Choose MARGIN FLOOR if:**
- Company is cash-constrained (need to preserve profitability)
- Shareholders prioritize margins over growth
- Products have short shelf life (better to sell at higher margin than not sell)

**Choose STOCKOUT AVOIDANCE if:**
- Market share is critical (e.g., new market entry)
- Stockouts damage brand reputation more than lost margin
- Competitors are aggressive (can't afford to lose customers)

**Balanced Approach:**
1. Set margin floor at 10% (minimum to cover overhead)
2. Accept stockout risk for top 20% of SKUs (high velocity)
3. Reduce discount for bottom 80% (slow movers) to preserve margin
4. Use dynamic pricing: start high, lower if stock doesn't move

**In UAE Context:** During major shopping festivals (Dubai Shopping Festival), favor stockout risk tolerance to capture market share. During normal months, favor margin floor to ensure profitability.

### 4. What did you exclude to finish in 2 hours?

**Excluded Features (Scope Control):**

1. **Machine Learning Models** - Would need training data and feature engineering (30+ min)
2. **Advanced Forecasting** - ARIMA/Prophet time series predictions (45+ min)
3. **Customer Segmentation** - RFM analysis or clustering (30+ min)
4. **Multi-constraint Optimization** - Linear programming to find optimal discount mix (40+ min)
5. **Real-time API Integration** - Live inventory sync or payment gateway data (60+ min)
6. **User Authentication** - Login/permissions for multi-user access (20+ min)
7. **Automated Email Alerts** - Notify managers of constraint violations (15+ min)
8. **Export to PowerPoint** - Auto-generate executive summary slides (30+ min)

**Priority Decisions:**
- **Must Have:** Data cleaning, KPI calculation, basic simulation, toggle views
- **Should Have:** Constraint checking, visualization, filters
- **Nice to Have:** ML models, optimization, advanced analytics
- **Won't Have:** Real-time integration, authentication, automated reporting
