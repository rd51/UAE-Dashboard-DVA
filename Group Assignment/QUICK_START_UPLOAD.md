## ⚠️ Important Rules

### IDs Must Match
- All `product_id` in Sales must exist in Products
- All `store_id` in Sales must exist in Stores
- All `product_id` in Inventory must exist in Products
- All `store_id` in Inventory must exist in Stores

### Column Names Matter
- Use **exact** spelling (case-sensitive)
- Don't use spaces in column names
- Required columns cannot be omitted

### Data Types Matter
- `qty`, `stock_on_hand` = Numbers only (integers)
- `selling_price_aed`, `unit_cost_aed` = Decimal numbers
- `product_id`, `store_id`, `order_id` = Text/String
- Channel = "App", "Web", or "Marketplace"
- City = "Dubai", "Abu Dhabi", or "Sharjah"

## 🔧 Common Preparation Steps

### In Excel / Google Sheets
1. Create your data or open existing data
2. Clean column names (remove spaces, special characters)
3. Delete empty rows
4. Ensure each column has the right data type
5. Save As → CSV format
6. Download CSV file

### Column Name Cleanup
| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|---------|-----------|
| Product ID | product_id |
| Store_ID | store_id |
| Selling Price | selling_price_aed |
| Unit Cost | unit_cost_aed |
| Qty Ordered | qty |

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### For Large Datasets
- If dataset > 100k rows, performance may slow
- Solution: Use data for 1 month instead of 1 year
- Or sample 10-20% of your data

### For Testing
- Start with 10-50 records to verify format
- Then upload full dataset once format is correct

### For Troubleshooting
- If error occurs, check column names first
- Check that all IDs match across files
- Try pre-built data to confirm dashboard works

### For Multiple Datasets
- Can switch between datasets anytime
- Just select different radio button
- Re-upload new files when switching

## 🆘 When Things Go Wrong

### Error: "Products missing columns: {'unit_cost_aed'}"
→ Check your Products CSV has column: `unit_cost_aed`

### Error: "Stores missing columns: {'city', 'channel'}"
→ Check your Stores CSV has columns: `city` and `channel`

### Error: "Please upload all required files"
→ Make sure you uploaded: Products, Stores, Sales, Inventory (Issues is optional)

### Dashboard shows "No data"
→ Check: Are product_ids in Sales also in Products?
→ Try: Select "Custom" preset to see all data

### Simulation button does nothing
→ Try: Pre-built data first to confirm dashboard works
→ Check: Your data has at least 10 orders

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Can I use Excel files directly?**

**Q: What if I have missing data?**
A: Fill with 0 for numbers, "Unknown" for text

**Q: Can I upload data while dashboard is running?**
A: No, select upload option before starting. Or restart dashboard and reselect.

**Q: Will my data be stored on a server?**
A: No, data stays on your computer. Streamlit keeps it in memory only.

**Q: Can I upload non-CSV files?**
A: Only CSV files are supported. Convert Excel/JSON to CSV first.
