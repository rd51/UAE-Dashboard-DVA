Your enhanced dashboard includes **10+ premium features** that most students won't have. Here's what makes it different:

---

## 🎨 **1. DARK MODE TOGGLE**

**Why it's unique:** Professional apps like Bloomberg Terminal have this  
**Implementation:** Toggle button in header with custom gradient backgrounds  
**Wow factor:** 9/10 - Shows UI/UX thinking

```python
# Users click "Dark Mode" button and entire dashboard transforms
if st.session_state.dark_mode:
    # Dark gradient: #1a1a2e → #16213e

    # Light gradient: #f5f7fa → #c3cfe2
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Don't overcomplicate during demo** - Show 4-5 features, not all 17
2. **Practice dark mode toggle** - It's a showstopper but needs smooth demo
3. **Prepare for "How did you do X?"** - Know which libraries you used (Plotly, Streamlit)
4. **Have backup** - If enhanced version has issues, fall back to basic `app.py`
